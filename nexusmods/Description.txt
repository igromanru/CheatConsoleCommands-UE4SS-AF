[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/font]
I made the mod primary out of need to be able to stay alive while developing my mods.
Also in contrast to mods based on "chat commands" you might not want other players to see that you're modding/cheating.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The mod makes a use of Unreal Engine's default console which gets enabled through [b]ConsoleCommandsMod[/b] and can be accessed with the hotkey [b]F10[/b]. (ConsoleCommandsMod is a part of UE4SS and is enabled per default)
I override some default UE commands which aren't working properly with the game and add a lot of own commands to it. See the list of commands below.

[size=3]Unreal Engine Scripting System aka. [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS]RE-UE4SS[/url][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. Scroll down to [b]Assets[/b] dropdown (open it) and download the [b]UE4SS_v{version nummber}.zip[/b] (e.g. UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]CheatConsoleCommands[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\CheatConsoleCommands\[/i]
Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\CheatConsoleCommands\
[/i][/size]5. Done, you can change mod's hotkey, if you want (see below).

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Feedback and Feature requests[/b][/size][/font]
Any feedback and feature request are currently welcome.
Simple let me know in the comments section.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.
