[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/font]
I made the mod primary out of need to be able to stay alive while developing my mods.
Also in contrast to mods based on "chat commands" you might not want other players to see that you're modding/cheating.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The mod makes a use of Unreal Engine's default console which gets enabled through [b]ConsoleCommandsMod[/b] and can be accessed with the hotkey [b]F10[/b]. (ConsoleCommandsMod is a part of UE4SS and is enabled per default)
I override some default UE commands which aren't working properly with the game and add a lot of own commands to it. See the list of commands below.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/font]
[size=3]Unreal Engine Scripting System aka. [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS]RE-UE4SS[/url][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. Scroll down to [b]Assets[/b] dropdown (open it) and download the [b]UE4SS_v{version nummber}.zip[/b] (e.g. UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]CheatConsoleCommands[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\CheatConsoleCommands\[/i]
Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\CheatConsoleCommands\
[/i][/size]5. Done. You can find the list of commands below.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]How to use[/b][/size][/font]
[list][*]Open game's command console with [b]F10[/b]. Press F10 one time to open in "quick type" mode and second type to open fully.
[*]Use command "help" to get a detailed list of all possible commands, with "help (command alias)" you can get information about a special command
[*]Type one of the command aliases from below to trigger the command.
[*]Most commands can be enabled and disabled by typing the same command, but commands like "money" will be executed once.
[/list]
[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Settings Auto Save System[/b][/size][/font]
Since v1.4.0 the toggle state of commands will be saved to a file and restored automatically when you start the game next time.  
It will also automatically change Leyak's cooldown to your last set value.  
Obviously all your saved locations will be saved as well.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Recommended UE4SS settings for better performance[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]If you experience lag spikes, I highly recommend to change this settings.[/size]
1. Navigate to the game directory where you've installed the UE4SS: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]e.g. [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
2. Open [b]UE4SS-settings.ini[/b] with any text editor.
3. Find following entries and change them as following:
[code]bUseUObjectArrayCache = false
GuiConsoleEnabled = 0[/code]
4. Save the file.
[size=2]If you still experience performance issues, write a detailed comment what happens, your PC specs and which mods you use.[/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Additional information[/b][/size][/font]
[list]
[*]Most features are based on debugging functions created by game developers to help them develop the game.
[*]The most noticeable is [b]Free Crafting[/b]. It doesn't behave as you would expect. It unlocks ALL recipes and simulates the possession of all possible items temporary, but after disabling it might take a while until it resets OR you have to reload/rejoin the game.
[*]Most features work only if you host the game or in singleplayer, I'll try to find "exploits" to trick the server, but don't expect much. To make most use out of mods I recommend to host your game locally.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
[list]
[*]Console command handlers of UE4SS are currently not very stable. Expect crashes after leaving a game or trying to close the game and report any unexpected crashes. 
[*]Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.
